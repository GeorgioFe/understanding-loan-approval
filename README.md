# COGS 108 - Data Science in Practice

## Final Project Group 119 - Understanding Loan Approval

### Project Overview
This project, conducted for COGS 108 in Fall 2023, explores the relationship between an applicant's credit history and loan approval status in America. Using machine learning, we predict loan eligibility based on features like credit history, income, and loan amount.
